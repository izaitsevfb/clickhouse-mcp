# ClickHouse MCP - Documentation Processing

This project provides tools for processing ClickHouse documentation, focusing on chunking markdown documents for embedding and search.

## Documentation Chunking

The project includes two chunking implementations:

1. **Original Chunking (`tools/chunk_md.py`)**
   - Splits markdown by H1, H2, and H3 headers
   - Does not control chunk sizes
   - Creates both very small (< 100 chars) and very large (> 100K chars) chunks

2. **Improved Chunking (`tools/chunk_md_improved.py`)**
   - Target chunk size: ~10,000 characters 
   - Maximum chunk size: 40,000 characters
   - Keeps small documents (â‰¤15,000 chars) as single chunks
   - Chunks by H2 sections by default
   - Merges small sections (<1,000 chars)
   - Implements force chunking for oversized sections
   - Generates unique keys for all chunks

## Usage

### Running Chunking

```bash
python tools/chunk_md.py --save
```


### Analyzing Chunk Size Distribution

```bash
python analyze_index_with_histogram.py
```

## Testing

Run unit tests for the improved chunking implementation:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_chunk_md_improved.py
```
